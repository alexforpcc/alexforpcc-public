					<h1>Alexander's Biography</h1>
					<p>My name is Alexander (Alex) Diaz Rios-- I am a passionate advocate for education as a first-generation college graduate and public-school teacher. I currently teach social studies and college/career readiness at Westview High School and CREATE Alternative School. As a lifelong resident of Washington County and a former Portland Community College student, I understand the growth and challenges facing our community.</p>

					<p>I have experienced the high cost of higher education and relied on the vital retention/support programs as a first-generation college student. As a student, I witness and hear the struggles that many college students face such a lack of guidance, food insecurity, and raising tuition. Through my dedication and hard work, I earned a Bachelors of Science in Social Science from Portland State University and a Masters of Arts in Teaching from Pacific University.</p>

					<p>I have been committed to serving students and the community by working in schools for the past eight years. As part of a group of dedicated young Latinx leaders, I helped found the Willamette Chicano Alliance, a non-profit that serves Latinx youth with college/career readiness, leadership, and mentoring programs. I also serve on the budget committee for the city of Hillsboro and the Hillsboro School District, providing me insight in fiscal responsibility.</p>

					<p>As a teacher, I work directly with seniors who are anxiously developing their next steps after high school. Many of my students worry about the cost of higher education, transitioning to college, and career options. I am dedicated to building a community coalition to find innovative ways to address the evolving needs of students and partners in our area.</p>

					<p>Prior to teaching, I was a graduation coach at Liberty High School-- a role where I mentored predominantly at-risk Latinx boys. In this role, I gained extensive experience working with students, educators, administrators, and community members. I value teamwork and collaboration in finding creative and effective solutions. My work at Liberty HS increased the number of graduation coaches, started a pilot program for ethnic studies, and expanded college and career readiness initiatives.</p>

					<p>I was raised by a single mother, along with my six sisters and one brother. As a brother and proud uncle, my family is the most important thing to me. In my free time, you can find me exploring nature throughout Oregon, reading about history, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

					<p>I am grateful by the support I have received and look forward to becoming a voice to for students, staff and all stakeholders by serving as the Board Director of Portland Community College for Zone 7.</p>

					<h1>Finance Equity:</h1>

					<p>Community colleges are expected to be impacted in the next biennium, as forecasted by the state’s budget. To ensure that Portland Community College is able to maintain and operate at current service levels, I will work tirelessly on legislative advocacy to help achieve stable and adequate education funding to prevent a tuition hike that would adversely affect unrepresented and first-generation students. I plan to advocate on the behalf of Portland Community College and provide testimony to elected officials in Washington County and throughout the state.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A budget process that is student-centered with an equitable framework</li>
